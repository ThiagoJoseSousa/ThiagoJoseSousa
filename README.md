# Hey, nice to see you.

As someone who creates content and manages social media, I have always had a user-centric mindset. This led me to transition into freelancing in Front-End development. Over the past 1.5 years, I have learned to develop seamless digital experiences that blend both aesthetics and functionality to create a satisfying user experience.

### What I do

I specialize in creating websites, and I prioritize writing clean code
in my projects. As a practice, I avoid using third-party libraries in 
my study cases. Web development is my passion, and I believe that utilizing
the tools and resources that people have spent so much effort creating is 
truly amazing.
