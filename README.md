### What I do

I specialize in creating websites, and I prioritize writing clean code
in my projects. As a practice, I avoid using third-party libraries in 
my study cases. Web development is my passion, and I believe that utilizing
the tools and resources that people have spent so much effort creating is 
truly amazing.
