### What I do

I am a web developer who specializes in building websites. As a practice,
I try to avoid using third-party libraries in my projects. For instance, 
in my MPA project, I use NodeJS to make requests and store user data in a 
dedicated folder. Web development is my passion, and I find it fascinating
to utilize the tools and resources that people have put so much effort into
creating.
